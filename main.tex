  \item Uses free and open source software; \texttt{Arch Linux} for daily
    driver, \texttt{OpenBSD} for servers.
  \item Writes inductive/recursive definitions and undergraduate level
    formal proofs with them in \texttt{Lean} and \texttt{Coq}.
  \item Manages projects written in \texttt{C}, \texttt{Python},
  \texttt{Scheme} and beforementioned languages/systems with
  \texttt{git}.
  \item Reads, writes and speaks English and French fluently.

\section*{\textsc{Interests}}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Reading and writing poems. Printable document of my poems
    compiled in a book can be found at:
    \url{http://oneofvalts.sdf.org/media/}. For the source code, visit
    its git \href{https://github.com/oneofvalts/usavurdu}{repository}.
  \item Typesetting, typography and bookbinding.
  \item Fountain pens, inks and papers.
  \item Modal, microtonal music. Irish and Turkish Folk Music. I play one

\end{itemize}
\section*{\textsc{Projects}}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item As part of my graduation project, currently formalizing
    Desargues' Theorem in Lean. Relevant repositories are
    \href{https://github.com/oneofvalts/desargues-doc}{here} and
    \href{https://github.com/oneofvalts/desargues}{here}.
  \item I wrote proofs of some basic propositions on equivalence classes
    and modular arithmetic in Coq. The code is
    \href{https://github.com/oneofvalts/equivalence-classes}{here}.
  \item I have a Youtube
    \href{https://www.youtube.com/@veryarticulateloudthinker}{channel}
    where I talk about \texttt{Lean} and document my journey of
    formalizing Desargues's Theorem.
  \item I typeset Cashmere Exchange's
    \href{https://docsend.com/view/ryp2wmfc5yxaabep}{whitepaper}.
  \item I have a blog at \url{http://oneofvalts.sdf.org}.
  \item I initiated \textsc{hatirlana}, where a group of authors including me
  resumes the past month's intellectual happenings. It is a monthly
  publication, typeset in \LaTeX. It has a git
  \href{https://github.com/oneofvalts/hatirlana}{repository}.
  \item I wrote \texttt{letter}, an ncurses program in \texttt{C}, for
  facilitating the bookkeeping of anagrammatic poems. It has a git
  \href{https://github.com/oneofvalts/letter}{repository}.
  \item I host the radio show \textit{ferahfeza chronicles} at \texttt{sdf}'s
  icecast internet radio \texttt{anonradio}, where I discuss Turkish
  Classical Music and perform with tambur.
